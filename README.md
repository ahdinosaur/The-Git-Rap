```
yo, this is the git rap
we gonna do it like this
we gonna do it like that
some use a gui, and i guess thats fine
but your boy right here prefers the command line

git init to git the party started
git add them files and then we git retarded
got no no idea what what what is in store
just a touch that file dot-git-ignore

so, now we taking the tour
got files added, don't need no more
yo this is too legit to quit
so its time for the git commit
i do a dash-a to specify them all
dash-m with the message that ima show y'all
this is the first commit and we standing tall
git push origin master you dont wanna brawl

chillin in my dash-b boy stance
git check it out yo to make a new branch
top of the mountain pushing down code like an avalanche
SVN and CVS never had a chance
its undisputed its distributed 
all the boys and girls agree the github
octocat is the cutest 
im a github boss title unrefuted
follow ahdinosaur right now

mein, this is the git rap
i am your git teacher
and you could get slapped
man, you better check yourself
man, is the tool to help you help yourself
man, then name the tool before you wreck yourself
run man git to get knowledge and wealth

so, back to the lesson at hand
git status to determine to the plan
git diff color to see where i am
i get with git every day i can
this is the git rap and i am the git man
wait you mean li-li-linus, mr linux royal highness
he made git the best he can so you know it is the finest
anyone not using git needs to be reminded its
imperative to distribute authors of the code
if we didnt have git the linux kernel would probably explode
so says we all even the hypnotoad
the shoulders of giants is where we rode
we roll in compliance with the history of code

( code code code code code )

```
